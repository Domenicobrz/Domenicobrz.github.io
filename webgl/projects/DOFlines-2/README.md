How to use
======

Inside `libs/createLines.js` you can code the scene you want to render, only lines are supported atm, here's an example on how to populate the `lines` array:

```javascript
function createLines() {
    // lines is a global array
    lines.push({
        // first vertex of the line
        x1: x1,
        y1: y1,
        z1: z1,
    
        // second vertex of the line
        x2: x2,
        y2: y2,
        z2: z2,
    
        // color of the first vertex, can take values bigger than 1.0
        c1r: 1, 
        c1g: 0,
        c1b: 0,

        // color of the second vertex, can take values bigger than 1.0
        c2r: 0, 
        c2g: 0,
        c2b: 1,

        // optional, if $useLengthSampling is set to true this variable will change the weight this lines has in the distribution of points for each line
        weight: 1,
    });
}
```

------

You can change various parameters of the renderer by modifying the values in `libs/globals.js`

```javascript
// camera parameters
var cameraFocalDistance = 49.19;
var bokehStrength = 0.095;
var exposure = 0.0019;
// set to 1 to have non-linear increase in focal strength
var focalPowerFunction = 0;

// how big lines should be on screen when they're in the focal plane
var minimumLineSize = 0.015;

// how many render calls are made each frame
var drawCallsPerFrame = 5;


// wether each line has assigned a quantity of points proportional to its length or a fixed number instead
var useLengthSampling = false;

// if $useLengthSampling is false, every line will by rendered by default with $pointsPerLine points
var pointsPerLine     = 25;

// if $useLengthSampling is true, every line will be drawn with an amount of points that is proportional to the line's length,
// use $pointsPerFrame to determine how many points will be drawn in a single drawcall. Keep in mind that each line is drawn with
// at least one point
var pointsPerFrame = 1000000;
```

The threejs source attached in the repo was modified to always disable frustum culling (check `libs/main.js` to see the exact changes)
