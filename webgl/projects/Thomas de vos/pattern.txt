pattern1:     mesh.active
   requires changes to:
     • forloop iterating meshes array
     • create a ready() function in mesh class
     • probably change the routine which sets all meshes to notifyRelease false


pattern2:     swapMeshesRoutine 
   requires:
     Set every mesh to notify release, as soon as they disappear, swap the      contents of the meshes array. A good time to implement a FSM
   requires changes to:
     • mouse controller won't accept inputs if we're on swapping state
     • a routine to check that all meshes are, infact, unactive
     • set mouseController.infocus to false, this will immediately release all bound meshes
